### Genomics Project: Prediction of m6A RNA modifications from direct RNA-Seq data

#### Project Overview

In this project, you will develop a machine learning method to identify m6A RNA modifications from direct RNA sequencing data. The method will then be applied to analyze data from the SG-NEx project.

#### Task 1: Develop a machine learning method to identify RNA modifications from direct RNA-Seq data

Write a computational method that predicts m6A RNA modification from direct RNA-Seq data. The method should be able to train a new model and make predictions on unseen test data. Specifically, your method should fulfill the following requirements:

* **Two Scripts:** Your method should contain two scripts: one for model training and one for making predictions. The prediction script will be evaluated by other students.
* **Model Training Script:**
    * **Input:**
        * Direct RNA-Seq data processed by m6Anet (in JSON format, see below)
        * m6A labels (see below for format)
    * **Output:** The trained model (any format of your choice)
* **Prediction Script:**
    * **Input:**
        * Direct RNA-Seq data processed by m6Anet (in JSON format, see below)
        * Optional: The pre-trained model from the first script could be used as an input argument (it can also be accessed within the code directly instead)
    * **Output:** Predicted m6A sites (see below for specific output file requirements)
* **Code Availability and Documentation:**
    * **Public GitHub Repository:** The code needs to be accessible through a public GitHub repository at the time of submission.
    * **Executable Code:** The code needs to be executable.
    * **Documentation:** The repository needs to be documented.
        * **Installation:** How to install the code/software and any requirements
        * **Running:** How to run the code
        * **Test Data:** Provide a small test data set to run the code (for the prediction script only, this is not required for the training script).
        * **Evaluation:** The code and documentation will be evaluated by other students on an AWS Ubuntu machine.

#### Format Description

* **Direct RNA-Seq Data (data.json):**

Each line of data.json describes the nanopore direct RNA sequencing reads that are aligned to the reference transcript sequences. Each line corresponds to one position in a transcript and shows the data from all reads that are aligned to this position.

Each line is formatted as follows:

```json
{"ENST00000000233":{"244":{"AAGACCA":[[0.00299,2.06,125.0,0.0177,10.4,122.0,0.0093,10.9,84.1],[0.00631,2.53,125.0,0.00844,4.67,126.0,0.0103,6.3,80.9],[0.00465,3.92,109.0,0.0136,12.0,124.0,0.00498,2.13,79.6],[0.00398,2.06,125.0,0.0083,5.01,130.0,0.00498,3.78,80.4],[0.00664,2.92,120.0,0.00266,3.94,129.0,0.013,7.15,82.2],[0.0103,3.83,123.0,0.00598,6.45,126.0,0.0153,1.09,74.8],[0.00398,3.75,126.0,0.00332,4.3,129.0,0.00299,1.93,81.9],[0.00498,3.93,127.0,0.00398,2.51,131.0,0.0111,3.47,79.4] â€¦ }
```

Going from the start of the line to the end, we have the following quantities of interest:

* **ENST00000000233:** The transcript ID for this particular row of data.json
* **244:** Represents the position within transcript ENST00000000233 which is described by the features in this line.
* **AAGACCA:** Describes the combined nucleotides from the neighboring flanking position (positions 243, 244, and 245 of the transcript ENST00000000233). At each position, 5 nucleotides (5-mers) pass through the pore; the sequence of the corresponding 5-mers represented by AAGACCA will be AAGAC (position 243), AGACC (position 244), GACCA (position 245). The middle 5-mer of the sequence (in this case AGACC), will always be one of the 18 DRACH motifs (D=A,G, or T, R=A or G, while H is A, C, or T).
* **Nested List of Numbers:** Represents the features extracted from each read that is mapped to transcript ENST00000000233 at position 243 (1- flanking position), 244 (the central position), and 245 (the +1 flanking position). Each feature was summarized from the raw signal data corresponding to positions 243, 244, and 245 of the transcript. The features from the first read will be [0.00299,2.06,125.0,0.0177,10.4,122.0,0.0093,10.9,84.1], from the second read will be [0.00631,2.53,125.0,0.00844,4.67,126.0,0.0103,6.3,80.9], and so on.
* **Features:** Each position is described using 3 features: (1) length of the direct RNA-Seq signal of the 5-mer nucleotides (dwelling time), (2) standard deviation of the direct RNA-Seq signal, and (3) mean of the direct RNA-Seq signal.
* **Reads:** For each read, we have extracted features from segments corresponding to the -1 flanking position (243), the central position (244), and the +1 flanking position, resulting in a total of 9 features for each read (3 features for position 243, followed by 3 features for positions 244 and 245 respectively).

* **m6A Labels for Training (data.info):**

The m6A labels for training are given as a data.info file with the following format:

```
gene_id,transcript_id,transcript_position,label
ENSG00000004059,ENST00000000233,244,0
ENSG00000004059,ENST00000000233,261,0
ENSG00000004059,ENST00000000233,316,0
```

Each line describes the coordinates of one position in the transcriptome that can be modified by m6A, and the respective modification label:

* **gene_id:** The gene associated with the transcript (as given by the transcript_id)
* **transcript_id:** The transcript ID
* **transcript_position:** The position in the transcript
* **label:** Describes whether a specific position within a transcript has the m6A modification. The label will be 0 if the position is unmodified and 1 if the position has the m6A modification. Modification labels are obtained using m6ACE-Seq.

The labels (data.info) and the signal data (data.json) can be matched using the transcript_id and transcript_position columns.

* **Predicted m6A Sites:**

The following format is expected for the submitted predictions:

```
transcript_id,transcript_position,score
ENST00000005260,425,0.03794821493241728
ENST00000005260,467,0.03789510558677051
ENST00000005260,542,0.08970181109437239
ENST00000005260,585,0.014504787924707616
```

* **CSV Format:** The file has to be in csv format, separated by ",".
* **Matching Data:** The values from the columns transcript_id and transcript_position must exactly match the transcript ids and positions in data.json.
* **Score:** The column score describes the probability that the given site has the m6A modification, so it must be a floating point with a value between 0 and 1.

* **Model:**

You can save the model during model training in any format.

#### Training Data:

Training data from the Hct116 colon cancer cell line will be made available.

#### Task 2: Prediction of m6A sites in all SG-NEx direct RNA-Seq data sets

Predict m6A RNA modifications in all direct RNA-Seq data sets from the SG-NEx data using your method. Describe the results and compare them across the different cell lines. Summarize and visualize your observations.

All data is available as .json files through the SG-NEx project: [https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data](https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data) which is hosted on AWS ([https://registry.opendata.aws/sgnex/](https://registry.opendata.aws/sgnex/)).

Please refer to the data access tutorial for information on how to access these files.

#### Resources and Cloud Usage (AWS)

Please use AWS for the project as the evaluation will also be done on an AWS ubuntu instance. Each team will get US$100 AWS credit per student. The AWS credits need to be sufficient for the team project and for the student evaluation of other teams. The budget will only be managed at the team level, therefore any team member can use up all AWS credits for the team.
